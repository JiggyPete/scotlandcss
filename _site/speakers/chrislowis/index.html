In this gallop through the history of synthesis from the Theremin to the MiniMoog, granular synthesis to physical modelling, we'll learn about the technology and theory of music synthesis. More importantly we'll hear what these synths sound like and how you can create your own sounds in just a few lines of JavaScript using the Web Audio API. We've got a lot of ground to cover, but the post-talk session and the code samples provided will give you a great start in your own audio experiments.
