  Yep, this isn't a JavaScript talk (although I do mention it a few times) this is a talk about CSS. So why is it relevant to JavaScript developers?
</p>

  If you are a JavaScript developer then you probably have to write CSS as well. If you're a JavaScript developer and you write CSS then you probably don't enjoy writing CSS.

  This talk will explain why you don't like writing CSS and show you some techniques for writing maintainable CSS that have been proven on large scale projects

  You might never love CSS but, by understanding it better and using it better, you can learn to tolerate it.
