  Starting to test drive your JS application can be daunting. You read a tutorial, it seems easy enough, get setup and then hit a brick wall. Test Driving your JS apps for the first time outside of the sterile environment of a contrived tutorial scenario is hard. With a lot of practice this the process gets easier, getting pointers in the right direction speeds up the cycle dramatically and this is what this talk aims to deliver. We will walk through concrete examples of real world code, evaluate different strategies of test driving our design and yield great, well tested results.
