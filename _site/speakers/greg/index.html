  As a user experience professional, I work hard to consider the end user in developing products. However, without knowing it we all bring a bias to our work simply because we haven't experienced certain things others have. This bias leaves our products and users wanting.

  Two years ago my eyes were opened to this as I developed a disability that changed everything in my life. "UX of Stairs" discusses the impact on my life this illness has had as well as how it opened my eyes to things in the physical and digital worlds that previously went unnoticed by me and many others.

  The talk is broken into three sections. In the first portion I will walk the audience through what is is like to experience my specific condition, a vestibular disorder that affects everyday life from walking to driving, from using the web to watching movies, from showering to cleaning the house.

  Section two provides examples of how our world is designed against those with disabilities. Attendees will hopefully take away open eyes so that as they walk through their own worlds they will see how things can be improved.

  Section three are specific steps we can take as the tech community now to create better experiences for our users. I'll discuss approaches to building, researching and testing our ideas so that the end product doesn't discriminate against anyone.
