  title: 'Practical Color Theory for People Who Code'
  bio: "Natalya Shelburne is a classically trained fine artist who spent 6 years lecturing and teaching people how to paint, draw, and grow their creativity. Upon realizing that the Renaissance had in fact already ended, she decided to join the modern world and is now a front end developer.<br/><br/>Natalya works to blur the line between designer and developer by sharing and updating old school design theory for the web. Crossing domains is a passion - in addition to a degree in Studio Art, she has a bachelor’s in Developmental Psychology and a master’s degree in Creativity and Talent Development, and works to weave interesting facts about how our brains work, learn, and develop into every talk.<br/><br/>When she is not writing code, she is drawing, cooking, traveling, or drinking absurd amounts of coffee."

  title: 'Using Musical Scales to Build Harmonious Typography'
  bio: "I’m a Chicago native currently loving the mountains of Denver after a long sojourn in the Carolinas. When I’m not building websites, I love to read suspense/espionage fiction or watch comedy. Time with my wife Audrey & tiny daughter is always a delight, and I rarely say no to fantastic food & drink.<br/><br/>When I am building websites, I love developing clever animations: motion is one of the best ways to delight users and help them understand their interaction with content. I want to make content accessible to every user, so responsive design is a must. I also want to keep things organized for future me or future developers, so I’m using Sass to keep style code as clean and light as possible."
