  title: "Code at the Center: Front-end Prototype for great experiences"
  bio: "Adekunle Oduye (Add-eh-koon-lay Oh-due-yay) is a Product Designer at <a href='https://justworks.com/'>Justworks</a> where he is building HR tools for small businesses. He enjoys driving innovation in design systems, data visualization and UI animation. When he isn't building software, you can probably find him planning his next travel adventures or learning more about personal finance."
  abstract: "Wireframes and mockups often fail to demonstrate the actual experience of a product. More often than not, the final product doesn't look anything like the mockups we created. So without using the latest design tool, are there ways to design quickly & work with others? Enter the front-end prototype!"

  title: "Functional CSS at Scale: Clean & composable UI on a massive app"
  bio: Eli Fitch is a front end developer with a passion for web performance, animation and all things 3D. He works on creative tools to design expressive maps at Mapbox, a startup in his hometown of Washington, DC. He also organizes the DC CodePen Meetup, and dabbles in design, 3D art & game development.  When not sat in front of a computer, he restores his perpetually broken stable of 70s motorcycles and attempts to keep his historic row-house from collapsing in on itself like a dying star.
  abstract: "We’ve all been there: the point when an app outgrows its CSS system, and things fall apart. Functional CSS, a set of tiny classes composed to make fully styled components, saved Mapbox's furiously complex map design app from this fate. Come hear why we love functional CSS, and why you might too."

  title: From front-end developer to typeface designer
  bio: I’m a front-end developer with a strong love for typographical details. My projects span from large, maintainable code bases, Sass, design systems and style guides, designing in the browser as well as with Sketch.app. Whenever I find a way to automize things, to create an open-source solution, like the LivingStyleGuide Gem. I’ve been co-organizing Eurucamp and the Berlin Ruby User Group. Now I spend all my free time designing my own typeface.
  abstract: "I’m addicted to typography. It started with a designing few characters for some signs a few years ago and since then it taken on a life of its own. One off projects are fun, but I wanted to create something bigger: a complete typeface. My talk will get you as excited about typefaces too."

  bio: 'Peter has a deep passion for the web and all its potentials. In his work he is a constant advocate for the end user and seeks holistic solutions that can play on all tangents from accessibility and user experience to hard core performance and tooling automation. During his 15-year frontend career he fell in love with open source and build tool automation. Two questions continue to drive him to seek out new frontiers: "Can it be simpler?" and "Can it be automated?"'
  abstract: "Web fonts and web performance are diametrical opposites. Your time to meaningful paint suffers from inefficient loading. Web fonts are also empowering your designers to improve legibility and keep brand consistency. Choose one: Performance or design? I'm here to tell you how you can have both"
