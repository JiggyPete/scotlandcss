    <header><h3>Tutorial Description</h1></header>
    <p>
			Each year, more applications are being written for the browser entirely in JavaScript. Yet, few developers write any automated unit tests of their JavaScript code. If that describes your experience and you're interested in taking front-end web technologies more seriously, then consider investing the time in this workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
			This workshop will be much more than a pedestrian review of information you could easily glean from a README or a written tutorial. Instead, attendees will be given opinionated, hands-on tour of how the presenters actually write code at their day jobs. That means we'll introduce the 'vanilla' Jasmine API, but we'll quickly pivot to a workflow that we believe is even better; with tools like jasmine-fixture, jasmine-stealth, jasmine-given, and CoffeeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
			The workshop will be punctuated by a number of pair-programming labs: starting with a basic test-driven-development exercise, moving onto testing more complex object interactions, and graduating to AJAX and DOM manipulation situations that in a real web application. Importantly, we'll introduce a cadre of workflow and productivity tools to ensure that your time writing (and testing) JavaScript is not only productive, but enjoyable!    </p>

      Justin Searls has two professional passions: writing great software and sharing what he's learned in order to help others write even greater software.

    <p>
      He and his team at Test Double have the pleasure of living out both passions every day, working closely with clients to find simple solutions to complex problems. His community efforts are focused on improving the more painful aspects of writing software, which might explain why you see him talking so much about JavaScript.    </p>

	    	Maggie's provides free practical, emotional and social support to people with cancer and their family and friends, following the ideas about cancer care originally laid out by Maggie Keswick Jencks.
	    </p>	
	    <p>
				Built in the grounds of NHS cancer hospitals, Maggie's Centres are places with professional staff on hand to offer the support people need.
			</p>    
	    <p>
	    	Our Centres are places to find practical advice about benefits and eating well; places where qualified experts provide emotional support; places to meet other people; places where you can simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	The first Maggie's Centre opened in Edinburgh in 1996 and since then Maggie's has continued to grow, with 17 Centres at major NHS cancer hospitals in the UK, online and abroad.
