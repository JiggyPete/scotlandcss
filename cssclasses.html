          <h2>What is CSSClasses?</h2>
          <p>
            CSSClasses are one day events for people who are interested in learning how they can create and manipulate elements on a website. A group of experienced developers will be by your side all day and make sure you return home with a lot of new knowledge. The event itself is seperated into two parts: A workshop where you will learn how to get creative with CSS and a hackathon where you can then make your hands dirty and work on your own little fun project.
