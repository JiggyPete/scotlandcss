      <h2 class="section-heading customfont">Code of Conduct</h2>

      <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at ScotlandCSS are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
Staff will enforce this throughout the event.</p>

      <p>If you need help please contact us.</p>

      <h3>The Quick Version</h3>

      <p>ScotlandCSS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants, visitors of the venue or event staff in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks and workshops.</p>

      <p>If a conference participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

      <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

      <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff.</p>

      <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

      <p>This code of conduct is slightly modified from <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">http://confcodeofconduct.com</a>. We will continue to refine as appropriate.</p>

      <h3>22nd May 2018</h3>
      <p>
        On Tuesday 15th May 2018 an issue was raised to the team as a matter of concern regarding the social media interactions of one of our speakers. These interactions led to a serious escalation that jeopardised an individual's employment and financial security.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think of our speakers as being role models for attendees and future speakers and this incident fell below that standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having investigated and gained perspectives from various members of our team, we felt that the only course of action was to retract the speaker's invitation to participate in ScotlandCSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have worked very hard to cultivate a positive inclusive environment and our responsibility is to maintain this environment for our attendees.
