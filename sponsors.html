      Zendesk was started in a Copenhagen loft by three friends who used an old kitchen door as a desk. They wanted to bring a bit of zen to the chaotic world of customer support. And they wanted to do it with software that was nice to look at and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, the company has grown. The software is now built all over the world, by a growing group of talented, charming people. The offices are bigger and we have real desks, but we've held on to the spirit with which we began: be genuine, listen to customers, and keep it beautifully simple.

<h2>Diversity Support</h2>
    <p>
      ScotlandJS has received a great deal of positive feedback about how warm, welcoming and friendly our event is.
    </p>

    <p>
      For 2016 we want to go even further, and are explicitly focusing on setting a new standard of inclusivity.
    </p>

<p>
We want to be accessible and supportive to people from underrepresented groups, building their trust and encouraging their participation within the community.
 </p>

To achieve this we need your support, which will allow us to:
<ol>
  <li>offer travel and accommodation support to speakers from underrepresented groups.</li>
  <li>offer 30 free tickets to each event to people from underrepresented groups.</li>
  <li>offer scholarships (financial assistance with travel and accommodation) for up to 5 attendees who would not be able to attend otherwise.</li>
  <li>offer free childcare to attendees.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We have divided these items so you can support our efforts in a way that makes sense for your company, be that supporting a single (or many) speakers, scholarships or attendees, or simply make a donation.
</p>
<p>
In return, we will put your company's logo in the Supporter section of this website and let everyone know of you are helping us establish a stronger, more diverse and inclusive community!

</p>
