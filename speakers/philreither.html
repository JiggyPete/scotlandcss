  What do you hate more? Setting up your dev environment or deploying to production? What about adding new software to your stack-on all of your servers and dev environments? Ever spend time figuring out why something won't run on production? In this talk I will show you how Docker takes the pain out of all of these.
</p>
<p>
  Docker lets you treat your app's infrastructure like code. You can put it in Git. You can share it with colleagues. You can run multiple environments on your laptop. And, come deploy time, setting up a new server, be it for production or a new colleague, is easier than making a good cup of coffee. Awesome!
</p>
<p>
  In this talk I will show you how I use Docker to make my everyday development easier, how we use it in our startup to set up and upgrade servers, and why it promises to be the most disruptive deployment technology of the next couple of years. I will also describe how Docker compares to and can actually be combined with the likes of Vagrant, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible.
