  In a world where there is a continual churn of javascript framework all with different ideas and compromise to be made, you could be forgiven to throw them all out and do it all yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Thats what this developer did after 2 years of developing a JS heavy front end I decided to change tack and develop a front end application with no framework, few dependencies and re-discover just what standard javascript can do.
</p>
<p>
  In this talk I will go over my experiences of working with no framework, the considerations made, frustrations and overall would I do it again?
