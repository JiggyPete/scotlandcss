  Shaders! Amazing little things: a few lines in a C-like language and we can get smooth colours pulsating on the screen or a first-person shooter. In WebGL that we have running on our browsers there are vertex and fragment shaders, we are going to take a closer look at the latter.
</p>
<p>
  Fragment shaders are programs which perform a very specific task: to compute a colour. And each program is calculating a pixel, blissfully unaware of any other pixels or programs, so it can run all by himself in its own computer. Picture this: when we have thousands or millions of independent computers running in parallel we can compose an image thousands or millions of times faster.
</p>
<p>
  But is that all we can do with shaders, drawing pictures? Not really! An image, in the end, is just a piece of memory that we choose to read as a picture. But a chunk of memory can be so much more, it can hold any data! And with fragment shaders we can perform many tasks on that data and speed them up incredibly.

<p>
  Searching big sets of data, doing complex calculations, even synthesising music!
