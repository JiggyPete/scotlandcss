RESTful web design is the current best practice model for building an API. This talk will focus on how we should be approach building clients for those services. Hypermedia is a powerful tool in the box for buildings clients that do not also happen to be web browsers and I'd like to take the opportunity to present a way that focusses on building a client that can exploit this power. Approval times for an App Store need not be a blocker for introducing new functionality and you don't have to force everyone to upgrade to the latest client all the time if you follow a few rules. Keep as much logic out of the client as possible, and focus on link relations and their meaning. This session is recommended primarily for anyone who builds clients for HTTP web services but also those on the server side - looking to see how the other half live.
