  Living style guides as a representation of UI are very popular in modern frontend development. And the next step further is a style-guide-driven development of UI components which means that your living UI book becomes your development playground. In such a process we developers change our mindsets from developing web as pages towards developing systems built of independent components. With this talk I am going to share experience of SC5 Online on this style-guide-driven way which we got with our own style guide generator.

  The talk is for frontend developers (mostly CSS/SASS/LESS). It shows and explains the benefits of style-guide-driven development which is a next step further in developing complex web interfaces. After the talk the audience will have clear understanding of how positively a living style guide can help in many aspects of development. I will also present my company's style guide generator and explain why internally in our development process we needed some unique features of it. While describing how we made the tool I will shortly mention a lot of technical challenges we faced such as parsing CSS, SASS and LESS, encapsulating component styles and driving it all open source from very beginning.
