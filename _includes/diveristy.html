          There is funding to support a number of:
          <ul>
            <li>Diversity Support Tickets - which means a free ticket for you!</li>
            <li>Scholarship - which means a free ticket and assistance with travel and accommodation!</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Diversity Support Tickets are aimed at helping those within daily travelling distance of the conference attend when they would otherwise be unable.
